# advent-of-code
Repo for my solutions to the 2020 Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com/2020)

I've always wanted to learn Rust, but never really got around to it. Solution: Use this as an opprotunity to solve a
bunch of problems and learn a new language at the same time! So, this project is entirly in Rust, albeit a very beginners
style. This isn't the most efficent of sytaxtically sweet way of solving any of these problems, but they do what they are asked.
